Hey, I'm making a website using Three.js (3d for web, basically). I'm pretty new to this (and web design in general) so I wouldn't recommend following my code, but some nice tutorials:

 This one by Fireship laid out some pretty good foundations: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7AOvWpIVHU&t=2s
 
 Not cheap but I've started following this course by Bruno Simon: https://threejs-journey.xyz/ 
 (the website also has some really cool demonstrations of the potential with finished work)
 
 And of course the official website! https://threejs.org/
 Lots of documentation, and loads of neat examples.
